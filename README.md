Helping clean up your dependency tree forest.

## Stuff to do ##

- [ ] Parse SBT output and construct the dependency tree
- [ ] Find clashes
- [ ] Trace dependencies to particular projects
- [ ] Basic UI
- [ ] Add target rules
- [ ] Find dependencies satisfying and not satisfying the target rules
- [ ] Automatic upgrade of dependencies using target rules

## Future things ##

- [ ] Integrate with SBT and pull the dependency information out rather than parsing it
- [ ] Handle semantic versioning
- [ ] Query repositories to find when dependencies are outdated
